# NewsBot

This Python script fetches the latest Google News RSS headlines for a user-supplied list of topics and sends a nicely formatted email digest. It uses Google Gemini to prioritize headlines. Designed to run daily using `cron` on any Unix-based system.

---

## How it works

- Reads [this configuration file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OjpsQEnrNwcXEWYuPskGRA5Jf-U8e_x0x3j2CKJualg/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Sheets with topics, keywords and overrides
- Retrieves the latest news headlines for all topics from Google News RSS
- Queries Gemini to prioritize these headlines according to your preferences
- Sends you a clean HTML email digest
- Schedule with `cron`
