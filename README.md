# NewsBot

This Python script fetches the latest Google News RSS headlines for a user-supplied list of topics and sends a nicely formatted email digest. It prioritizes high-importance headlines using keyword and topic scoring, and ensures each email contains fresh, non-repeating articles. Designed to run daily using `cron` on any Unix-based system.

---

## How it works

- Finds top news stories from Google News
- Selects topics in `topics.csv` that have similarity to top headlines
- Scores and filters the latest stories for those topics
- Avoids showing you the same headlines twice
- Sends you a clean HTML email digest
- Schedule with `cron`

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brayvid/newsbot.git
cd newsbot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip3 install nltk requests python-dotenv scikit-learn
```


### 3. Prepare Configuration Files

- `.env` â€“ contains email credentials and recipient:

  ```env
  GMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
  GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
  MAILTO=recipient@example.com
  ```

  (You must [enable 2FA](https://myaccount.google.com/security) and [generate an App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) for your Gmail account.)


- `topics.csv` â€“ your list of prioritized topics, one per line:

  ```
  Topic,Weight
  Artificial Intelligence,5
  Renewable Energy,5
  ...
  ```

- `keywords.csv` â€“ relevant keywords to influence scoring:

  ```
  Keyword,Weight
  war,5
  invasion,5
  nuclear,5
  ...
  ```

- `overrides.csv` â€“ banned and demoted keywords:

  ```
  Keyword,Action
  fox news,ban
  daily mail,ban
  entertainment,demote
  ...
  ```
---

## Running the Script

```bash
python3 newsbot.py
```

To automate daily delivery:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add a line like the following:

```cron
0 8 * * * cd /path/to/newsbot && /usr/bin/env python3 newsbot.py >> logs/newsbot.log 2>&1
```

This runs the script every day at 8:00 AM server time.

---

## Lockfile Notice

If the script fails or is force-terminated, it may leave behind a lockfile at `/tmp/newsbot.lock`. To remove it manually:

```bash
rm /tmp/newsbot.lock
```

---

## Logging

All script logs are saved to `logs/newsbot.log`. The `logs/` directory will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.

---

## Customization Tips

- Adjust `TREND_WEIGHT`, `TOPIC_WEIGHT`, and `KEYWORD_WEIGHT` to fine-tune relevance scoring.
- Lower `MIN_ARTICLE_SCORE` to include more articles.
- Use richer keyword and topic lists for more comprehensive coverage.
- Increase `MAX_ARTICLES_PER_TOPIC` if you want more results per topic.
